# Password Strength Checker

This Python project is a password strength checker that evaluates a password based on specific criteria such as length, inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It provides feedback on how to improve the password and classifies its strength as "Very Strong," "Strong," "Moderate," "Weak," or "Very Weak."

## Features

- Checks if the password meets the following criteria:
  - Length of at least 8 characters.
  - Includes at least one lowercase letter.
  - Includes at least one uppercase letter.
  - Includes at least one number.
  - Includes at least one special character (e.g., `@`, `#`, `!`, etc.).
  
- Based on the criteria met, it classifies the password strength as:
  - **Very Strong**: All criteria are met.
  - **Strong**: Four out of five criteria are met.
  - **Moderate**: Three out of five criteria are met.
  - **Weak**: Two out of five criteria are met.
  - **Very Weak**: One or no criteria are met.

- Provides feedback to the user on what aspects of the password need improvement.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-strength-checker.git
   cd password-strength-checker
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages (if any):**

   This project doesn't require any external libraries, but you can install `re` as a built-in module in Python.

## Usage

1. Run the script in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python password_strength_checker.py
   ```

2. Enter the password you want to evaluate when prompted.

3. The script will output the password strength and provide feedback on areas of improvement.

## Example

```
Enter your password: Password123!
Password Strength: Very Strong
```

### Feedback:

- No feedback if all criteria are met.

Or for a weaker password:

```
Enter your password: password
Password Strength: Very Weak
Feedback:
 - Password should be at least 8 characters long.
 - Password should include uppercase letters.
 - Password should include numbers.
 - Password should include special characters.
```

## Code Overview

- **password_strength_checker.py**: Main script that evaluates the password strength based on the defined criteria. Uses regular expressions (`re`) to check for lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters.
  
- The function `password_strength_checker(password)` takes a string `password` as input and returns the strength of the password as well as feedback for improvement.
